# Double Quote Replacer app
## Introduction
This is a small macOS app that are able to take in a long string, and converted double quote (") into the supported version in a string (\")

## Background story
I always find myself in trouble to replace " into /" when I program in C/C++, and Swift 3,
Although in Swift 4, I am able to use triple quote (""") just like in Python; but I still find this useful sometimes.
